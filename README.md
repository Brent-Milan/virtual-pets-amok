Virtual Pets Amok Project

Brent Milan

Description: 

	A nine class, two interface revisiting of the VirtualPet Shelter project. The objective of the game is to keep all robot pets charged and maintained, while also keeping the organic pets fed and watered. The objective of the project is to highlight the power of class inheritance (extending class) and implementing interfaces.
	Pet stats must be maintained and the needs of the pets vary by their type and class. Organic pets must have their hunger and thirst levels kept down. An additional layer of complexity is added by the robotic pets having different needs from their organic counterparts. Instead of keeping their primary stats down, you have to keep their energy and maintenance levels up. Happiness must be kept up for all pets.
	Interfaces can add further wrinkles like allowing dogs to be affected differently from walking than robotic dogs.
