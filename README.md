Virtual Pets Amok Project

Brent Milan

Description: 

	A nine class, two interface revisiting of the VirtualPet Shelter project. The objective of the game is to keep all robot pets charged and maintained, while also keeping the organic pets fed and watered. An additional layer of complexity is added by the shelter litter box and organic dogs (specifically) benefiting from being walked. 
	
Currently some of my boolean "drivers" for the do-while loop are broken. I will be refactoring after submission.
